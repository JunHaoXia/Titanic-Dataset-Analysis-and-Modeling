# Introduction
This repository contains Python code for analyzing the Titanic dataset and building predictive models using various machine learning algorithms.

## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Read the Titanic dataset and perform initial data exploration.
Drop unnecessary columns and handle missing values.
Explore the relationship between socio-economic status and other features.
Explore the distribution of survival victims in relation to age, gender, socioeconomic class, etc.
## Part 2: Modeling and Question Answering
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a Decision Tree Classifier and evaluate its performance.
Train a Linear Regression model and evaluate its performance.
Train a Logistic Regression model and evaluate its performance.
## Summary of Findings
Younger individuals were prioritized for survival, with the majority of survivors falling into the 0-18 and 19-30 age groups.
Passengers in higher classes were more likely to survive, as indicated by the moderate negative correlation between Pclass and survival.
Females had a higher survival rate compared to males.
The embarked port did not significantly affect survival rates.
## Conclusion
The Decision Tree Classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 80.38%, with a precision of 75.38% and recall of 76.56%.
The Linear Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 72.89%, with a precision of 75.38% and recall of 76.56%.
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 79.89%, with a precision of 74.19% and recall of 71.88%.
